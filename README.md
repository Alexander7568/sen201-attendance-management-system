Attendance Management System (AMS) — SDLC Enhanced Notes

Definition

An Attendance Management System (AMS) is a computerized system used to record, store, manage, and analyze attendance for students or employees accurately, efficiently, and securely.

The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, step-by-step process used to plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain this system.

SDLC Flow for Attendance Management System

1. Planning Phase

Purpose

To determine the goal, feasibility, scope, and resources required for the Attendance Management System.

Key Activities
	•	Identify system objectives (e.g., reduce manual attendance errors)
	•	Conduct feasibility study (technical, financial, operational)
	•	Define project timeline and budget
	•	Identify stakeholders (teachers, HR, students, management)

Output
	•	Project plan
	•	Feasibility report

⸻

2. Requirements Analysis Phase

Purpose

To understand what the system must do and what users expect.

Key Activities
	•	Collect user requirements (interviews, surveys, meetings)
	•	Define functional requirements
(e.g., record attendance, generate reports)
	•	Define non-functional requirements
(e.g., security, speed, usability)
	•	Document system constraints and expectations

Output
	•	Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

⸻

3. System Design Phase

Purpose

To create a blueprint for how the system will work.

Key Activities
	•	Design system architecture
	•	Create database structure (attendance tables, student records)
	•	Design user interface (login page, dashboard)
	•	Define hardware and software requirements

Output
	•	System design document
	•	Flowcharts, diagrams, and prototypes

⸻

4. Development Phase

Purpose

To build and code the Attendance Management System.

Key Activities
	•	Write program code
	•	Develop database and system modules
	•	Build interfaces (admin panel, attendance input screen)
	•	Integrate system components

Output
	•	Working system software

⸻

5. Testing Phase

Purpose

To ensure the system works correctly and is error-free.

Key Activities
	•	Unit testing (test each module)
	•	Integration testing (test combined modules)
	•	System testing (full system test)
	•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Output
	•	Bug-free and validated system

⸻

6. Deployment Phase

Purpose

To install and launch the system for real users.

Key Activities
	•	Install system on servers or computers
	•	Transfer data from old systems
	•	Train users (teachers, HR staff)
	•	Go live with the system

Output
	•	Fully operational Attendance Management System

⸻

7. Maintenance Phase

Purpose

To keep the system running smoothly after deployment.

Key Activities
	•	Fix bugs and errors
	•	Improve system performance
	•	Add new features (biometric attendance, mobile access)
	•	Update security and software versions

Output
	•	Updated and optimized system

⸻

Why SDLC is Important for Attendance Management System
	•	Ensures system reliability
	•	Improves accuracy of attendance records
	•	Reduces manual workload
	•	Enhances security and data integrity
	•	Makes the system scalable and maintainable
